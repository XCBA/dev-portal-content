MachineFi Lab is making great progress with Meta-Pebble and we’re excited to start seeing developers build groundbreaking geo-location dApps with the Meta-Pebble platform.  In addition to building new dApps, developers will also be able to add geo-location functionality to existing dApps. This phase is significantly important as we set up Meta-Pebble for the next exciting period of development where the community can start enjoying unique ways to earn rewards via their smartphones. 

Since Meta-Pebble was first introduced, its scope has greatly expanded with the ambition of delivering an even more enriching experience. By first opening Meta-Pebble as a developer platform, it will be more programmable. Rather than only serving as proof of presence for the IoTeX network, developers will be able to build a wider array of applications that will better serve more people, with more options, in the future. 

We are excited to announce that the developer’s preview version is now available. If you’re a developer looking to build a dApp using Meta-Pebble and would like to start using it, email hello@iotex.io or reach out to Jeremi or Simone on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/q5eYde2CU7Join) channel. Join our [Developer Portal](https://developers.iotex.io/) with your GitHub account to claim IOTX tokens on Testnet, and get started with plenty of blog articles and tutorials to help you build your dApps on IoTeX. 


Using the Meta-Pebble Developer Kit, developers will be able to build dApps that have verified location data received from devices connected to users’ wallets while W3bStream provides the framework and foundation for Meta-Pebble to build on top of. Meta-Pebble connects devices and machines in the physical world to the blockchain world. 

There are myriad dApps waiting to be developed that will use location data. We’re already beginning to see dApps such as STEPN making inroads in the Move-to-Earn space. Now imagine dApps that promote tourism or visiting business districts using NFTs or token drops as rewards. Or how about city governments incentivizing the use of green transportation over private car use? Would you like to spend a day or two in New York City’s Central Park to get an NFT for each of the 31 arches and bridges you could visit there? 

We know these ideas barely scratch the surface of what will be built with Meta-Pebble. And we know the developer community’s creativity is boundless.


## Getting started with Meta-Pebble

In the recent IoTeX Town Hall (Aug. 19, 2022) Qevan Guo, co-founder of IoTeX, gave a brief presentation outlining how developers will be able to work with Meta-Pebble. 

Qevan described Meta-Pebble as a “...dApp development platform for trusted locations”.

MachineFi Lab will soon be launching an SDK (Software Development Kit) that includes the Meta-Pebble App and access to Meta-Pebble W3bStream. We will also be providing a user permission system where devs register their dApp with the system and ask users for permission to use their device’s data. 

## The Developer Kit

Using the Developer Kit, developers will need to sign in with their wallets and register their dApp name and logo. dApps will also need to ask permission from users to get their device's data. This means that users retain full control over what and with whom they share their data by using wallet authentication. 

Now available: the developer’s preview version. If you’re a developer looking to build a dApp using Meta-Pebble and would like to start using it, email hello@iotex.io or reach out to Jeremi or Simone on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/q5eYde2CU7Join) channel.
